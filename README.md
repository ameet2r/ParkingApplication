# ParkingApplication: MariaDB Database Practice 

This application allows users of a company to manage multiple parking lots. Spaces in these parking lots can be assigned to staff members for a monthly fee, or can be reserved by staff members for visitors at no charge. The application allows users to add staff members, parking lots, parking spaces, create reservations, and assign a permanent spot to staff members through a user interface. 

The front end implementation is done using Java Swing, while the backend is done in Java to communicate with our MariaDB database. The SQL query is located in the root folder if you'd like to populate the database with pre-existing data. 

If you have issues connecting to the database, include the connector.jar file in your project.
